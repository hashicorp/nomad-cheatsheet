# Nomad Cheatsheet

A collection of cheatsheets for getting started with [Nomad](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad)! 



## Motivation

Learning new tools can be difficult at first, so we wanted curate and collect a series of cheatseheets to help you get started with Nomad. Since kubernetes is popular in the container orchestration world, we felt that the first couple cheat sheets should be focused on nomad commands and concepts from a kubernetes perspective. If you'd like to add to our existing cheatsheets or make new ones, see the [contributing](##Contributing) section below.
